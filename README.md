# NumberSystemGeneratorSkeleton
This is basic skeleton code for the optional number system generator problem set as problem 4 in the Introduction to Number systems worksheet (see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VHZd6hVjeZ-v9a3TMyR2JFqIixxC0bgI/view?usp=sharing) for worksheet).
Changes should be made to the NumberSystemGenerator class so that all unit tests pass.
